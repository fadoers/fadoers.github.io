The importance of design patterns will not be repeated any more. In order to understand the usage scenarios and skills of various design patterns in depth, I intend to follow the steps of design patterns, realize a simple text editor from scratch, and use common design patterns to design codes as much as possible.

This will be a series, from the most basic framework design to the compilation of functional codes of each module, and finally realize a simple, beautiful and easy-to-use text editor.

### target

1. Each chapter corresponds to a design mode
2. Each design pattern has corresponding code implementation
3. The final product is a workable and functional application
4. The code will be synchronized to GitHub
